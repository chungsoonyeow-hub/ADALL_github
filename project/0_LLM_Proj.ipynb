            "2. Remove (or explicitly exclude from training) guaranteed-post-creation / resolution fields (leakage).\n",
            "- Why: The task is to predict made_sla at ticket creation. Columns that represent resolution/closure state or later updates are not known at creation and will leak the answer (they directly reflect downstream events). Profile shows resolved_at, closed_at, resolved_by, closed_code exist and have many non-missing values—these will trivially correlate with SLA. (E.g., closed_at/resolved_at have many repeated timestamps; closed_code has strong frequency distribution like code 6 = 86,583).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Parse/convert datetime-like columns to datetimes.\n",
            "- Why: Many time fields (opened_at, sys_created_at, sys_updated_at, resolved_at, closed_at) are stored as object strings. Converting them to datetime enables correct sorting, extraction of creation-time features (hour/day), and proper identification of post-creation events. Profile shows opened_at has 19,849 unique strings, sys_created_at 11,553, sys_updated_at 50,664 — these are date/time-like and must be parsed.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Drop or reduce high-cardinality identifier-like columns.\n",
            "- Why: Columns that are IDs or effectively unique (or high-cardinality) can cause overfitting or blow up model dimensionality when later encoded. Example: number has 24,918 unique values (ticket id); opened_at / sys_updated_at are very granular datetimes (many unique); opened_by (208 unique) and caller_id (5,245 unique) are high-cardinality. The identifier \"number\" should be removed as it is a ticket identifier, not a predictive attribute.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Drop near-constant / very low-variance columns.\n",
            "- Why: Columns where ≥95% of rows have the same value have very little information and add noise. Profile explicitly lists near-constant columns: reopen_count, contact_type, cmdb_ci, notify, problem_id, rfc, vendor, caused_by. For example contact_type = \"Phone\" in 140,462 of 141,712 rows; notify = \"Do Not Notify\" in 141,593 rows. These should be removed or only kept if business logic says otherwise.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Handle numeric skew / extreme outliers for count features.\n",
            "- Why: Numeric columns are skewed and have many outliers: reassignment_count skew = 3.11 with max 27; sys_mod_count skew = 4.74 with max 129; reopen_count skew = 15.56 with max 8. High skew/outliers can harm distance-based/linear models and may distort feature importances; for tree-based models capping/extreme-value treatment is still recommended to stabilize training and limit influence of rare cases. Profile's IQR outlier counts show many outliers (e.g., sys_mod_count has 10,900 outliers by IQR).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Create missingness indicators for columns with meaningful missing rate.\n",
            "- Why: After turning '?' → NaN, some columns will have substantial fractions missing (e.g., cmdb_ci mostly missing: 141,267 out of 141,712 rows are '?'). Missingness itself can be predictive and should be recorded as a feature (or used to decide column removal).\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Reduce rare categories in high-cardinality categoricals (group infrequent categories to \"OTHER\").\n",
            "- Why: Many object columns have long tails (e.g., caller_id 5,245 uniques, assignment_group 79, assigned_to 235, resolved_by 217). For modeling later, grouping rare categories reduces cardinality and improves generalization. Use frequency-threshold grouping (e.g., categories with <1% frequency → \"OTHER\").\n",

Recomputing these counters at creation-time would restore potentially informative predictors without leakage.\n",
